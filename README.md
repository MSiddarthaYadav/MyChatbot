# 🗨️ Simple Chatbot

This is a basic rule-based chatbot built using Python. It uses a dictionary to match user inputs with predefined responses and provides simple conversational replies.

## 💡 Overview

The chatbot simulates a basic conversation by recognizing specific keywords or phrases. It continuously prompts the user for input and responds accordingly. If the input is not recognized, it provides a default response.

This project is ideal for beginners learning about how chatbots work at a basic level before exploring advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## ⚙️ Features

* Responds to common phrases like:

  * `hello`
  * `how are you`
  * `what is your name`
  * `bye`
* Handles unknown inputs with a fallback message
* Simple and interactive terminal-based interface
* Clean exit when the user types `bye`

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Download or clone the repository.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project folder.
4. Run the chatbot using:

```bash
python chatbot.py

You: bye
Simple Chatbot: Goodbye! Have a great day!
```

## 📌 Note

This is a basic example of a chatbot and does not involve machine learning or advanced NLP. It's designed to demonstrate how simple pattern matching can be used to create conversational behavior.
